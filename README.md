# CS50x 2021: Introduction to Computer Science

For you who come for the solutions, I'll have to say sorry because I'd moved my solutions to a private repository. It's simply because sharing the solutions is violating the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course. Don't worry, if you need any help, you can ask someone in the [communities](http://cs50.edx.org/communities), or you can [reach me](mailto:mufidu@outlook.com), too. Keep it up!
